                Utah is a great place to learn gardening. Utah has a great climate, inlcuding sunny summers, 
                long sunny springs, and harvesting vegetables can often continue late into fall. Growing your 
                own food is fun and can save you some of that <strong>cash</strong>. Not only that, but gardening forces you to
                diversify what you cook. This website is for those wanting to grow foods that produce much 
                volume in relatively small amounts of space. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to learn to garden and are strapped for <em>cash</em> (or you just like saving money),
                then this page will help give you direction on how to begin. On this page you can find recipes, plant ideas,
                garden maintanence tips, garden prep, etc. 
            </p>
            <p> Gardening can become a healthy addiction. There is something exciting about seeing a plant grow from a seed in the dirt
                to a full three-course meal on your plate. Gardening makes yardwork, cooking, and eating very personal and fun. It is amazing 
                what a little water, seed, and TLC can do. Last, but not least, it also is a great way to beautify your yard! Seeing the mosaic
                of yellow, green, orange, purple, yellow, pink, and red diversifies your yard and gives it its own personality.
